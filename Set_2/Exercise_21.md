**Exercise 2.1**

Numerical solution of the 1D heat transfer equation dT/dx + e^(-Î»x) = 0, using the Finite Elements and Finite Differences methods. The MATLAB file is a small application, where you can play around with the parameters and boundary conditions.
The Fortran file does the same, but without the Graphical Interface.
